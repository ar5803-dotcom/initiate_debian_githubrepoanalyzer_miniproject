Overview

This mini starter project, implemented on Debian Linux, serves as an introduction to working with the GitHub API and getting familiar with Linux distributions. The project utilizes Python and the requests library to extract information from a GitHub repository.

Project Process

1. **GitHub API Access:**
   The project leverages the GitHub API to retrieve detailed information about a specified repository. The API requests are made using a Python script that interacts with the GitHub server.

2. **Token Authorization:**
   To access the GitHub API, a personal access token is required. The token is used to authenticate and authorize the script to fetch repository details. It ensures secure communication with the GitHub server.

3. **Scope Selection:**
   The user is prompted to select scopes (permissions) for the personal access token. The chosen scopes determine the level of access the script has to the repository. Example scopes include `repo` for full control and `public_repo` for public repositories.

4. **Information Extraction:**
   The script extracts various details from the GitHub repository, including:
   - Repository name and description
   - Programming language used
   - License information
   - Number of stars, forks, watchers
   - Open issues count
   - Timestamp of the last update
   - A list of files in the repository

Technologies Used

- **Python:**
  The project is implemented in Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language.

- **requests Library:**
  The requests library is employed to make HTTP requests to the GitHub API and retrieve repository information.

- **GitHub API:**
  The GitHub API provides a programmatic interface to access and interact with GitHub features. It allows fetching details about repositories, users, organizations, and more.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-repo-analyzer.git
Install Dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Script:

bash
Copy code
python github_repo_analyzer.py
Follow the prompts to enter the required information.

Note
Ensure that you have a GitHub account and generate a personal access token with appropriate scopes. Visit GitHub Personal Access Tokens to create a new token.

This project is designed as a beginner-friendly exploration of working with the GitHub API and getting started with Linux. Feel free to customize and expand the project based on your learning goals.
